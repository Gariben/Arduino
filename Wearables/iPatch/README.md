iPatch
============

This is a cyberpunk eyepatch I made for the purpose of exhibition during musical performances.
It is a modified version of this eyepatch found on Amazon. It uses analog buttons as inputs
via an Adafruit Trinket Pro to produce lighting from Red 8x8 LED matrix, and an RGB LED ring.
[Here is a demonstration of a few test patterns.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YWV6PuEXgg)

The current source code contains three animations, but can easily be expanded to feature more animations,
with more cycles. The current animations don't reflect my best coding practices, since they were each programmed
in minutes for musical performances the same night.
